# DAY 3 
## PART 1:
> Every item type is identified by by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types
> of items). The list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always 
> has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in 
> the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.
